#### an excercise in making simple command line applications with TDD in MSTest

## a C# project

## description

* this is an epicodus project in our first week of using C# and .NET framework. it explores basic file structure, creating distinct classes, namespaces, fields, constructors, and methods.
* to calculate pastry cost, i employed simple algebra which allowed for experimentation with data types--a concept new to people like myself coming from a weakly typed language.  
* finally, i have experimented with testing in MSTest. it is a tedious but powerful tool, and i am interested to explore further what type of testing is possible here.

## setup/installation requirements

* open a terminal on your machine
* clone down the [repository from github](https://github.com/johnedisc/boulangerie-pierre-de-epicodus) inside the directory of your choosing
```bash
git clone https://github.com/johnedisc/boulangerie-pierre-de-epicodus
```
* move into the directory with Program.cs
```bash
cd BoulangeriePierreDeEpicodus/Boulangerie/
```
* start application
```bash
dotnet run
```
* follow along with the instructions there

## known Bugs

* when selecting a pastry quantity, if you give it a string 2 times in a row, it will terminate the application
